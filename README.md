# (Vanilla) JavaScript Snake Game

An implementation of the Snake game using plain JavaScript.

The goal of the game is for the snake (initially represented as a black square) to eat as many 'food' (represented by a red square) as possible by manuevering the snake to the food with the arrow keys. The game ends when the head of the snake touches the edges of the board or touches any part of its body.
